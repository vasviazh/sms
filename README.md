**Introducing SMS: Simple Messaging System**

SMS is a groundbreaking example application designed to showcase the integration of event-based
and multithreaded message exchange among separate program modules. Developed by Vasil Viazhevich
(vasviazh@gmail.com), SMS was presented as practical material at the C++ CoreHard Spring 2017 conference in Belarus.
This innovative tool allows users to test and compare the performance of multithreaded and event-based programming,
highlighting the architecture's flexibility and ease of setup. With SMS, you can explore the performance
differences between multithreaded and event-based applications while learning how to construct adaptable program
architectures. Whether for educational purposes or testing program performance, SMS offers a comprehensive
platform for exploration and experimentation.

Unlock the potential of SMS for your educational and performance testing needs.
